            What is house hacking?<br/><br/>

            House hacking is where you rent out space in your primary residence, or home.<br/>
            For many American's their mortgage is their biggest expense. By renting out space<br/>
            through traditional, long-term leases or short-term contracts and Air BnB, you can<br/>
            reduce your housing expenses dramatically.<br/>

            Real estate can make you money in four different ways. It is unique in that way<br/>
            because it is  multidimensional. Appreciation, tax-deductions, equity, and cash flow are the four ways.<br/>
            The traditional homeowner uses the first three advantages. They get appreciation by<br/>
            the value of their house increasing over time, tax deductions on the mortgage's interest<br/>
            that they pay each year, and equity as they own more of their property by paying off<br/>
            the loan. The fourth is by renting and producing monthly income.<br/><br/>

            For many first-time homebuyers, it is easy to overextend your budget. Dave Ramsey<br/>
            is one of the most credible voices on personal finance. His rule is to never pay more<br/>
            than 25% of your income on the mortgage or rent. In fact, when you spend more than 25% of your budget<br/>
            on housing you are unable to cover unexpected cost and become unable to sieze<br/>
            other opportunities that could benefit your life because the mortgage has taken most of your cash.<br/>
            The ability to move to get a better job is gone or invest in other ways is lost.<br/><br/>

            If you live in an expensive market, such as San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Washington,<br/>
            DC or Boston, this is your reality. In 2020, you can easily pay $3000 for a one bedroom<br/>
            apartment. If you are not making $144,000/yr then it would be hard to be under Dave Ramsey's<br/>
            25% rule. We don't want other parts of your life being held back because of mortgage or rent<br/>
            prices. Additionally, the housing market is hard to get into, coming up with a down payment<br/>
            can take years.<br/><br/>

            Many of us can't imagine living with a stranger, someone that we don't know living in your space<br/>
            using your kitchen, bathroom, and being inside your home when you're not in it. House hacking has<br/>
            its challenges.<br/><br/> 
        
            Before we go further and more into why House Hacking isn't something you'd like to consider. I'd<br/>
            like to discuss the advantages...<br/>
