            What's your investment philosophy?
            My philosophy is simple.  I like to save, automate, and think long term.

            I have a sixty percent savings rate that goes into my retirement and brokerage accounts.
            My portfolio consists of Vanguard mutual funds and index funds, VTSAX, VUG, and VGT are
            my biggest holdings. 

            These investments are meant to keep in the market forever. Hold long term and only invest money that
            you can afford to lose.

            For me, I can afford to lose sixty percent of what I make. I am living my best life knowing
            that I will have greater opportunities going forward, as my investments grow, and by prioritizing
            what I spend my money on.  
            
            Do you believe in timing the market?
            No.  There is conclusive evident that we cannot time our investments. My investments are 
            automated to protect myself from my biggest enemy, myself, and my emotions. 

            My personal financial system automatically withdraws money from my checking account monthly. 
            The automatic withdraw is set on my payday, so I only see the money I can spend on food, mortgage,
            and other expenses in my checking account.  The money is transferred into my Roth IRA and brokerage
            account where mutual funds are bought without me thinking.

            I don't particularly like to think about money and spreadsheets, so having it automated in diversified
            investments allows me to spend more time doing the things I enjoy, spending time on the beach and running
            are some of my favorite activities.
