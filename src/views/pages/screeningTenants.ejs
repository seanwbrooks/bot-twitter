                So you have your ad listing.  It is polished with clean pictures, details of what separates your home from the rest. You have set a great price, and you are ready to accept a tenant?<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                Before you go further, congratulations because you have done the work and have set yourself up for success.<br/><br/>

                All right, let's get down to business. It is important to have standards for your rental. The standards will help you find someone you can live with and help your future roommate find
                a place that has clear expectations.
                There were five standards that I had to help me place a person in an extra bedroom.
                My five standards were no pets, no smoking, credit score at or above 600, three times the rent in monthly income, and a clean background check.
                My rule of thumb is never accept a tenant that hasn't passed all your standards. It can be seen as tough, but it helps both parties. It helps you as a landlord
                get a good roommate and it helps the applicant from getting in a escalating situation where they were under the impression that they could get a 
                pet or smoke inside their room. But once, you have your standards. We can move on in the process, which is answering phone calls and emails to your ads.<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                With every inquiry, I ask the same opening question: "What questions can I answer for you?"
                This question does two things, it allows the inquirer to ask any questions they have upfront and gives you some perspective into who they are.
                You will be able to know in your first interaction with the person if they are serious and what problems they are facing.
                If the inquirer asks about the price of rent, smoking policies, or if their family will be able to inhabit with them then it is good to know these 
                things in your first interaction with them. I begin by asking this question because it has saved me time. It is a good method for getting a picture 
                of the renters wants and concerns. It is now your job to sell the property, explain why separates it from the rest and what great perks they get
                from renting at your place.<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                After answering their questions and giving your pitch, you will want to know if they will pass the rental standards. I ask them your five questions. "Do you have pets? Do you smoke?
                Do you have a credit score at or above 600? Do you make 3X the rent in monthly income? Do you have a clean background?" You want clear answers to each 
                question; otherwise, you will run the risk of wasting their time, by going further into the screening process, which makes rejection much harder 
                to deal with. If you are unsure about any of the answers, but have a good feeling about them, be sure to tell the inquirer that a screening will happen later in
                the process. If they fail for any standard, let them know immediately 
                and politely as possible. Be sure to give them the exact reason, making it clear why they
                are not accepted. To give you an example of what to say when someone says that "they'll smoke off the property", I say that per my condo association I 
                cannot accept anyone "who claims to be a smoker". This helps someone understand that accepting someone who smokes is outside my control.<br/><br/>

            <div class="row">
                Once you have gotten this far with someone who's questions are answered and pass the standards, you can now give them a list of next steps for seeing the 
                property. In my case, COVID-19 made it harder for me to invite people into my home. The next step in my process was to have an online showing through
                a video platform, such as Zoom, or Facetime. It doesn't matter which platform, whatever works for you or the inquirer is best. Having an online showing next
                gave me assurance that the inquirer would be serious by the time they made it to an onsite showing. Also it would give them some perspective as well.  During
                these 30 minute showings, I would get to know them, asking what they did, reinterating the standards, answer any questions, and show them the property. By
                the end of the half an hour, we would schedule an onsite showing and I would tell them to bring a mask to ensure the safety of both parties during the pandemic.<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                In normal non-pandemic situations, I would have inquirers 
                come to the property without the online tour as the first step. The importance of the onsite visit is critical for house hackers
                because it gives you some background, meeting someone in person is much different than email exchange and phone calls.
                This is the best time to get a sense of the potential tenant. Did they come presentable? Was their mode of transportation clean? Noticing these small details 
                can help you decide if this person is trying to be professional and presentable. They don't have to be wearing a suit, but they should have made an effort
                to look presentable. You want someone who cleans the dishes, pays rent on time, and conducts themselves well. The same rules are applied to you. Be honest and dress up.
                Have a positive attitude when showing that makes someone feel welcomed.<br/><br/>
            </div> 
            <div class="row">
                Onsite visits can be done two ways, you can give them a tour of the place or allow them to check it out themselves. Since I was showing my property in a
                pandemic I did a distanced showing, remaining 6 ft apart at all times from guests.  I would answer questions and get to know the inquirer in open spaces, such as the 
                porch or living room. In that time, be sure to ask them about hobbies, goals, and lifestyle to get a sense of what they like in a living situation with roommates. I knew I had a good fit
                when I heard that they like running, travel, and had other similarities as me, and I could see myself being friends with them. If you get a good vibe, explain 
                the next steps: email them a thank you for coming to see the property and application that will allow you to run a credit report and background check.<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                The screening application is the first document that you will have a prospective tenant fill out in full. It will contain their employment and rental history and consent to run a background check 
                credit report through a screen service of your choice. My favorite is <span style="display: inline;"><a href="https://rentprep.com/tenant-background-check-2/" target="blank" style="text-decoration: none;margin:0;">RentPrep</a></span> because 
                they send an email to the applicant. They fill out the report and pay for its cost, and you get a notification when the report is ready for review. It is so important that you do your due diligence and run a full
                report on their background and credit. Also, be sure that the entire application is filled out in full. You will need their references to call and a signature to
                legally run the report. I will save you hours of time by including a sample application <span style="display: inline;"><a href="../rental_application" target="blank" style="text-decoration: none;margin:0;">here</a></span>.<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                The next step is to wait until you have a clear background report and credit check. Make sure the background is clean, no convictions, and credit score is at or above
                your standard. Once this is done, you will need to call their references. Most important references are their previous landlords because they can give you a 
                prospective into their renters history, whether they paid on time and kept the house clean. In my experience, I knew I was going to offer an acceptance letter
                when the landlord had said it was the best tenant they ever had. After you call their previous landlords, I would call their employer to verify
                that their monthly income is correct and that they are employed where they say they are. It will give you a sense of peace when you
                can verify that the tenant makes three times the rent. Tenants who spend less than 33% of their income on housing are more likely to be able to
                 continue to afford their housing in the case of an unexpected emergency. They will have the cash flow.<br/><br/>

            <div class="row">
                Once you have done your due diligence, you can accept your future roommate! This is the time to celebrate because you have just converted your primary residence
                into a business that has monthly income and the ability to convert repairs as tax deductions. Not only that you have made your home a community, and gained a friend.<br/><br/>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                The last step would be to schedule a time to sign the lease. This time will include signing the lease, going over any things to help with move in, and the 
                exchange of keys. You can create a lease using <span style="display: inline;"><a href="https://www.ezlandlordforms.com/documents/rental-lease-agreements/" target="blank" style="text-decoration: none;margin:0;">EZ Landlord Forms</a></span> that 
                has forms custom made with state laws and regulations.<br/><br/>
