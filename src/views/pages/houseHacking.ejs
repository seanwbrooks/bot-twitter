            What is house hacking?<br/><br/>

            House hacking is where you rent out space in your primary residence, or home.<br/>
            For many American's their mortgage is their biggest expense. By renting out space<br/>
            through traditional, long-term leases or short-term contracts and Air BnB, you can<br/>
            reduce your housing expenses dramatically.<br/><br/>

            Real estate can make you money in four different ways. It is unique in that way<br/>
            because it is  multidimensional. Appreciation, tax-deductions, equity, and cash flow are the four ways.<br/>
            The traditional homeowner uses the first three advantages. They get appreciation by<br/>
            the value of their house increasing over time, tax deductions on the mortgage's interest<br/>
            that they pay each year, and equity as they own more of their property by paying off<br/>
            the loan. The fourth is by renting and producing monthly income.<br/><br/>

            For many first-time homebuyers, it is easy to overextend your budget. Dave Ramsey<br/>
            is one of the most credible voices on personal finance. His rule is to never pay more<br/>
            than 25% of your income on the mortgage or rent. In fact, when you spend more than 25% of your budget<br/>
            on housing you are unable to cover unexpected cost and become unable to sieze<br/>
            other opportunities that could benefit your life because the mortgage has taken most of your cash.<br/>
            The ability to move to get a better job is gone or invest in other ways is lost.<br/><br/>

            If you live in an expensive market, such as San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Washington,<br/>
            DC or Boston, this is your reality. In 2020, you can easily pay $3000 for a one bedroom<br/>
            apartment. If you are not making $144,000/yr then it would be hard to be under Dave Ramsey's<br/>
            25% rule. We don't want other parts of your life being held back because of mortgage or rent<br/>
            prices. Additionally, the housing market is hard to get into, coming up with a down payment<br/>
             takes years.<br/><br/>

            There is an answer for millenials trying to save more money and reduce financial stresses. House<br/>
            First you will need a down payment.  This is the hard part and as I said before can take years to do.<br/>
            I will try to give you more tips on getting that goal later, but first tell you that I borrowed my down <br/>
            payment. I presented it as an investment to a family member and they supported me. I knew that <br/>
            this would be a win-win for both of us. I had savings to cover any unexpected costs that occurred<br/>
            in the coming months of owning and I was going to turn the house into a business. In a few years, I<br/>
            I could pay them in cash if they wanted their money back or they could take their percentage of the <br/>
            house when it was sold. It was a long-term investment for them.<br/><br/>

            I had many worries. "How was I going to close?" "How would my taxes be different?" The list was long,<br/>
            and I knew that none of it was worth my time because nothing had happened. I focused on closing a house <br/>
            and learning about the systems I would need to convert the home into a business. The Bigger Pockets Podcase <br/>
            was a great resource and, in particularly,

            Brandon and Heather Turner that became invaluable to me in the process of screening a tenant.<br/><br/>

            There was another problem: How much would I charge for rent?<br/>
            I solved this by going on Craigslist and searching ads that matched my listing's criteria, a shared 1<br/>
            bedroom in my area. Once I got a sense of the market price, I verified my range with 
            <a href="https://www.rentometer.com/" target="blank" style="text-decoration: none;">rentometer.com</a>, a <br/>
            a pricing service that helps you understand your market's fair value.<br/><br/>

            In the Boston area, I could charge anywhere from $750-1000/mo on a 1 bedroom and shared bath in rent.<br/>
            This gave me some confidence knowing that I would bring home an additional $10,200 yearly income with a $850<br/>
            monthly rent. As you can imagine, putting this towards the mortgage would allow me to pay off my 30 mortgage<br/>
            in 15 years, which is a savings of $206,000 in my scenario! To find out what you could save, click
