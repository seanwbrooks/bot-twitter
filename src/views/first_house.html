                    <div class="card-text">&emsp;In many cases, it doesn’t make sense to buy a house.  It is scary to think about. It is expensive. There are so many reasons that ran through my head--how would I qualify for a loan, how did credit work, how would I come up with a down payment, and the whole process of buying a house.  Before any of these questions were answered I was convinced that buying and holding real estate was one of the pillars of reaching financial independence and building wealth.  By the time that I wanted a house I had got out of debt, changed my career into tech, and listened to countless Bigger Pockets podcasts. And I wanted to reach a place in my life where I could build a company, travel the world, have a family, and have time to spend with that family, and work in places and with people that I wanted to work with.  I wanted options.</div><br/>
                    <div class="card-text">&emsp;I had moved to Boston three years before knowing that I wanted to own real estate.  Boston had one of the most expensive markets in the country, ranking fourth in most expensive housing. There are great schools, such as Harvard, MIT, Northeastern, Boston University, Tufts, and Boston College, that keep demand for housing high in the area.  I was like everyone else at that time, real estate was too expensive.  There was no way that I could own.  Hell, I was living with my girlfriend’s mom.</div><br/>
                    <div class="card-text">&emsp;There were many mindset shifts that occurred in a span of two years.  The first occurred when I enrolled in a coding bootcamp. The very first thing I learned in coding bootcamp was a study originating out of Stanford University called the “Growth Mindset”.  Essentially, the Growth Mindset was simply a mindset or framework for looking at the world.  It was important for many of us non-technical students to learn in order to set us up for success in a highly technical and fast pace learning environment. As the program went on, I shifted my thoughts when I heard myself say “I can’t do this.”  My failures were transformed into learning experiences, and I learned to celebrate my victories.  I know that sounds really cheesy.  It took me a long time to believe in myself. I was notoriously hard on myself and felt like I was never good enough.  The practice of catching my thoughts working against me was something I had to think about each day.  So as you can expect, my thinking was a part of what I had to overcome when it came to thinking of the “unknownable” steps of homeownership and the “expensive” aspects of real estate.  (If you are interested in learning more about the Growth Mindset you can click <a class="card-link" href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/" target="blank">here</a>.)</div><br/>
                    <div class="card-text">&emsp;The second mindshift came when I heard Craig Curelop’s <a class="card-link" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/biggerpockets-money-podcast-95-craig-curelop" target="blank">story</a> about house hacking. Most people think that their house is an “asset”.  They frame its income-producing aspects on the appreciation or tax deductions, but forget about homeownership’s hidden expenses, loss of return and costs.  This is exactly what people mean when they say that housing is expensive. This fixation on the cost was completely true for me until I learned about Craig buying a house with little money down. He rented out all the rooms and lived on his couch.  He was able to live for free, meaning he had no housing expenses. In my case I could rent out an extra bedroom in a small 2 bed 1 bath condo.  I would be able to reduce my mortgage payment by 40%.  Why was this a revelation? In order to see I had to think long-term and look at my options at that point in time. I could continue renting paying $1800/mo living in a 1 bed/1 bath in Boston. If I had continued living there for 30 years, the net worth of living would be -$648,000.  Comparing that to the expense of traditional homeownership of a “forever home” of $300,000 with an FHA loan with 3.5% down would be -$285,000. Lastly, the benefit of renting out a room for $700/mo in the “forever home” would equate to -$285,000 (total housing cost) + $252,000 (rental income held as cash) = -$33,000.  As you can see, there are major differences between each choice. House hacking is by far the best strategy for eliminating your expenses and creating income.</div><br/>
                    <div class="card-text">&emsp;I was gaining momentum.  I could see that the decisions that I made today would have significant impacts on my future.  I knew that I could learn how to be a landlord because my friends were ones, and I lived with them in my 20’s. I knew the growth mindset and house hacking strategy. There was only one problem. My girlfriend, Dakota, and I had no money for a down payment. We began asking family for money with the hope to get out of our renting situation and into a position where we could house hack. My girlfriend’s mom knew Boston’s housing appreciation and gave us a down payment.  She had an investment.  In exchange, Dakota’s mother would get the percentage she put in as well as its appreciation when the loan was paid back. For Dakota and I, we would have our savings, in case something would need to be repaired as most houses do, and get into a better situation where we would no longer pay rent and be in a position to turn our living situation into a small business. It was a win-win. </div><br/>
                    <div class="card-text">&emsp;We closed on our first condo as our workplaces were going remote and the world was going into lockdown from COVID-19.  In the height of the pandemic, we worried that we would lose one of our jobs. Luckily, we had an answer for each situation that we could think of.  We bought a place that we could afford with one job. We were going to house hack to make more money.  We had savings because we borrowed money with no interest. I hope this article gives you some perspective on the possibilities and creativity in real estate. I am a firm believer that real estate is a main vehicle for establishing wealth. It is a great opportunity for many Americans to take back their lives and provide for their families. </div><br/>
